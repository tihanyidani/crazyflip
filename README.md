This project aims to reproduce the results of the following paper: [A simple learning strategy for high-speed quadrocopter multi-flips](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5509452).

My goal is to use learning-based control methods to perform multi-flips using a small indoor drone. To achieve this, I split the project into two steps: Simulation in [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/), and Drone flight using a [Crazyflie drone](https://www.bitcraze.io/).
